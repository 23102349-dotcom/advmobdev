## Screenshots and Notes

### Theme Implementation Note:
The theme switcher implementation provides a robust, scalable solution for managing app themes. It uses Redux for state management, ensuring consistent theme application across all screens. The animation system provides smooth transitions that enhance user experience, while the custom color picker allows for personalized theme customization. AsyncStorage integration ensures user preferences persist across app sessions.

### Camera Implementation Note:
The camera implementation offers a professional-grade photo capture experience with real-time filter application. The system uses expo-image-manipulator for efficient image processing, with React.memo optimizations ensuring smooth performance. The filter intensity slider provides fine-grained control over effect strength, while the comprehensive filter library (grayscale, sepia, vintage, cool, warm) caters to various creative needs. The implementation handles permissions gracefully and provides clear user feedback throughout the capture process.
